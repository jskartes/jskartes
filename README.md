# Hello, world. I'm Joshua Stephen Kartes.
I am a professional musician–turned–software developer. I have a natural, insatiable proclivity to **create**. As a developer, I am motivated by my desire to help foster the next generation of technologies and services that will spark and enable others' creativity and innovation.
